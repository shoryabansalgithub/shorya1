# DukaanAI - AI-Powered Retail Operating System

> **Status**: Active full-stack application. The web and API applications build successfully; deployment still requires provisioned MySQL, Redis, and Google OAuth credentials.

A world-class, enterprise-grade AI-powered retail operating system designed for small to medium-sized businesses. Built with cutting-edge technologies for scalability, performance, and user experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

DukaanAI is a comprehensive retail OS that combines:

- **AI Voice Billing** - Voice-activated point-of-sale
- **Smart Inventory** - Real-time stock management
- **Customer Udhar** - Credit/tab tracking system
- **Analytics** - Predictive business insights
- **Multi-Shop Support** - Enterprise multi-tenant architecture
- **WhatsApp Integration** - Direct customer communication
- **OCR Invoice Scanner** - Automated invoice processing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS
- MySQL 8+
- Redis 6.2+
- Google OAuth web-client credentials (only when Google sign-in is enabled)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies from the repository root
npm install

# Create local environment files from the committed templates
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# Apply database migrations, then start API and web in separate terminals
cd apps/api && npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run start:dev
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3001/api`; the web app listens on `http://localhost:3002` when started with its configured port. See [ENVIRONMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md](./ENVIRONMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md) and [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) before deploying.

### Keeping the database schema in sync

The Prisma schema evolves with the code. If your local database was created
from an older checkout, API endpoints that touch new tables/columns will fail
with Prisma `P2021` (missing table) or `P2022` (missing column) errors - the
API now detects this at boot with a schema probe, logs a loud
`SCHEMA DRIFT DETECTED` error, and refuses to start. The fix is always:

```bash
cd apps/api && npx prisma db push
```

Run it after every `git pull` that changes `prisma/schema.prisma` (make sure
`DATABASE_URL` in your environment points at your local database).

### Seeding demo data

An idempotent seed populates a realistic Indian retail dataset (shop products,
customers with udhaar balances, suppliers, employees, expenses, notifications,
and a month of invoices) so every page has real backend data:

```bash
# API must be running (it validates the real write paths via HTTP)
cd apps/api && npm run seed
```

The script creates entities through the public API where endpoints exist and
falls back to Prisma for the rest. Re-running it is safe - existing records
are detected and skipped. In auth-bypass mode the data lands in the system
shop; with real auth enabled it logs in as (or registers) the demo account
`demo@dukaan.local` / `Demo@1234` and seeds that shop instead.

### Verification

```bash
npm run type-check
npm test --workspace=api -- --runInBand
npm run build --workspace=api
npm run build --workspace=dukaanai-web
```

### Disabling authentication (development / demo only)

Authentication can be switched off behind an explicit, reversible flag. It is
OFF by default: when the variables are unset, empty, or anything other than an
explicit truthy value (`true`, `1`, `yes`, `on`), normal login is required. An
unrecognized value makes the API refuse to boot rather than guess.

- API: set `AUTH_DISABLED=true` in the API environment. Every request then runs
  as a provisioned system user (`system@dukaanai.local`, role OWNER, own shop),
  and the API logs a loud `AUTH DISABLED` warning at startup. The real auth code
  paths (including Google account provisioning and token verification) remain
  intact - the flag only gates access, it never accepts unverified identity.
- Web: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DISABLED=true` in the web environment. The login
  gate is skipped and the app loads directly. The value is inlined at build
  time, so for production builds it must be set before `next build`.

Set both flags together, and never enable them for a production deployment.

## Deployment

Use the checklist in [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md). Google OAuth must be configured with the exact callback URL `https://YOUR_WEB_ORIGIN/api/auth/callback/google`; set the matching `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in both applications and enable it in the web environment.
